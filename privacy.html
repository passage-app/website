		<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p class="statement">Your privacy is critically important to us.  Your data is your own.  We make no claims to it and will only use it according to the policies outlined below. </p>

<p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our <a href="mailto:andy@intrepidfrog.com.com">support team</a>.</p>


<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

<p>Passage manages and stores passwords on your device.  This data is only stored locally on your device.  It is never stored outside of the app. </p>

<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

<p>No Personally-Identifying Information is transmitted to external locations when using Passage.</p>

<h3>Use of Google User Data</h3>

<p>The Passage app will monitor the user's email accounts and process password related emails. Emails are used to determine if the user has an account that is protected by a password that can be managed by Passage. The data is stored on the user's phone whilst in use but not stored outside the phone. Email subject lines, sender domains, and dates are disassociated from emails and users, and sent as unconnected analytics data to be used to improve the app during the beta test period. Within the app, the subject, sender domain, and date of an email are used to determine whether it should be processed by Passage or ignored. Passage does not need to know the user's identity or the contents of the message to make this determinaation and this is solely done within the app on the phone. Passage will download the contents of the message if and only if it intends to process it. The body of the message is stored in the app whilst in use.</p>

<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Passage may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Passage's sole discretion. Passage encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
